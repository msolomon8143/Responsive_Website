					<h3> Nostalgic Air: BttldAir  </h3>

                   <p class="card-text">I love the cool air on a fall night. It is the perfect temperature and very rare to come by during the rest of the year. Well, it was until I found BttldAir. They're a small business that specializes in different styles of air that bare hard to come by. Through them I was able to purchase a monthly subscription to their 'Cool Air' box. Now I can feel that cool autumn breeze in the heat of summer. It's such a wonderful experience that it brings me to tears every time. It's a product like no other, and it just brings out the child in me (and all those locked memories of my childhood).</p>

                <p class="card-text">This air is the best air I have ever breathed. First, let's start with the packaging. Bttldair came in a selection of three different bottles, red, black, and clear. I mean talk about the variety, you just can't compare. The product came to me as soon as it shipped. Picking up this package was very easy, as the packaging was practically weightless, almost as if the product was just a bunch of plastic bottles. The air tastes were very crisp and very clear, opening the bottle was also a great experience. I've used bottled air in everyday life, from cleaning to baking to wrestling to bowling, you MUST get Bttldair!</p>

                <p>Bottled Air is the best air in the bottled air game. The freshness and ability to customize your ordered air is revolutionary. I couldn’t be happier about the air I received in the mail. Air nowadays can be a hassle to order because of its lack of freshness when delivered, but Bottled Air really knows how to formulate their air. My husband loves the different scented air. He’s tried all the scents and really loves the more natural wilderness scents like Oak and Waterfall. My kids tend to go towards the fruity and candy scents. Bottled Air has really kept my home a happy and healthy home. I really recommend buying the no scented air first and work your way to different scents. It can be overwhelming when buying bottled air to find the right scents and company. With Bottled Air it’s made easy to find good, fresh, quality air.</p>
